/*
The `Block` structure is a container for multiple instructions. It maintains a
dynamic list of `Instr` entries, along with metadata such as the current length
(`len`), capacity (`cap`), block name, and the line number of the next
instruction to be processed.

**Note:** The `Block` structure has no relationship with a Basic Block in a
Control Flow Graph (CFG). Regardless of how many branches exist in the source
file, only one `Block` will be created, containing all valid instructions in the
first pass. You should not split a `Block` based on labels, as it serves merely
as a storage structure for instructions, preparing for label-address
substitution in the second pass
.
### Example Usage
Consider the following test case:
```
add a2 a0 a1
or a4 a3 t0
jalr zero t1 0
```
After processing this input, the `Block` should have:
- `len = 3` (indicating three instructions are stored)
- `line_number = 4` (since line numbers start from 1, and the next instruction
to process is at line 4)

Each line of the input corresponds to an `Instr` entry in the `entries` array.
For example, the first instruction (`add a2 a0 a1`) is stored in `entries[0]`
with the following properties:

```c
entries[0].name = "add";
entries[0].arg_num = 3;
entries[0].line_number = 1;
entries[0].args = {"a2", "a0", "a1"};
```
This ensures that each instruction is correctly parsed and stored in the
`Block`.

There are no functions to be implemented in these files, but understanding the
purpose of these two structures will help you better complete the assembler in
the future.
